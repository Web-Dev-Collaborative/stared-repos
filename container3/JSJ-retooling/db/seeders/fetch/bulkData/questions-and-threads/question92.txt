CoffeeScript gives you interpolation when using the double quotes.</p>\n<pre><code>&quot;This is my #{name}&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#6th_Edition_-_ECMAScript_2015\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ECMAScript 6</a> is using back ticks (`) for template strings. Which probably has a good reason, but when coding, it can be cumbersome to change the string literals character from quotes or double quotes to backticks in order to get the interpolation feature.

Like in a console log or some kind of view-source setup.</li>\n<li>Similarity to other languages: In shell programming (Bash etc.), single-quoted string literals exist, but escapes are not interpreted inside them. C and Java use double quotes for strings and single quotes for characters.</li>\n<li>If you want code to be valid JSON, you need to use double quotes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>In favor of both</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is no difference between the two in JavaScript. Therefore, you can use whatever is convenient at the moment. For example, the following string literals all produce the same string:</p>\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>    \"He said: \\\"Let's go!\\\"\"\r\n    'He said: \"Let\\'s go!\"'\r\n    \"He said: \\\"Let\\'s go!\\\"\"\r\n    'He said: \\\"Let\\'s go!\\\"'</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Single quotes for internal strings and double for external. That allows you to distinguish internal constants from strings that are to be displayed to the user (or written to disk etc.). Obviously, you should avoid putting the latter in your code, but that can’t always be done.</p>\n"},{"score":3,"body":"<p>It is just a matter <em>time</em> for me.
