This means you can tell the scope of an identifier by looking at the source code.</p>\n<p>The four scopes are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Global - visible by everything</li>\n<li>Function - visible within a function (and its sub-functions and blocks)</li>\n<li>Block - visible within a block (and its sub-blocks)</li>\n<li>Module - visible within a module</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Outside of the special cases of global and module scope, variables are declared using <code>var</code> (function scope), <code>let</code> (block scope), and <code>const</code> (block scope). Most other forms of identifier declaration have block scope in strict mode.</p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Scope is the region of the codebase over which an identifier is valid.</p>\n<p>A lexical environment is a mapping between identifier names and the values associated with them.</p>\n<p>Scope is formed of a linked nesting of lexical environments, with each level in the nesting corresponding to a lexical environment of an ancestor execution context.</p>\n<p>These linked lexical environments form a scope &quot;chain&quot;. Identifier resolution is the process of searching along this chain for a matching identifier.</p>\n<p>Identifier resolution only occurs in one direction: outwards. In this way, outer lexical environments cannot &quot;see&quot; into inner lexical environments.</p>\n<p>There are three pertinent factors in deciding the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">scope</a> of an <a href=\"https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#sec-names-and-keywords\" rel=\"noreferrer\">identifier</a> in JavaScript:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How an identifier was declared</li>\n<li>Where an identifier was declared</li>\n<li>Whether you are in <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode\" rel=\"noreferrer\">strict mode</a> or <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Sloppy_mode\" rel=\"noreferrer\">non-strict mode</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Some of the ways identifiers can be declared:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>var</code>, <code>let</code> and <code>const</code></li>\n<li>Function parameters</li>\n<li>Catch block parameter</li>\n<li>Function declarations</li>\n<li>Named function expressions</li>\n<li>Implicitly defined properties on the global object (i.e., missing out <code>var</code> in non-strict mode)</li>\n<li><code>import</code> statements</li>\n<li><code>eval</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Some of the locations identifiers can be declared:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Global context</li>\n<li>Function body</li>\n<li>Ordinary block</li>\n<li>The top of a control structure (e.g., loop, if, while, etc.)</li>\n<li>Control structure body</li>\n<li>Modules</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Declaration Styles</h2>\n<h3>var</h3>\n<p>Identifiers declared using <code>var</code> <strong>have function scope</strong>, apart from when they are declared directly in the global context, in which case they are added as properties on the global object and have global scope. There are separate rules for their use in <code>eval</code> functions.</p>\n<h3>let and const</h3>\n<p>Identifiers declared using <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> <strong>have block scope</strong>, apart from when they are declared directly in the global context, in which case they have global scope.</p>\n<p>Note: <code>let</code>, <code>const</code> and <code>var</code> <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/31222689/38522\">are all hoisted</a>. This means that their logical position of definition is the top of their enclosing scope (block or function). However, variables declared using <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> cannot be read or assigned to until control has passed the point of declaration in the source code. The interim period is known as the temporal dead zone.</p>\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\" data-console=\"true\" data-babel=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>function f() {\n    function g() {\n        console.log(x)\n    }\n    let x = 1\n    g()\n}\nf() // 1 because x is hoisted even though declared with `let`!</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n<h3>Function parameter names</h3>\n<p>Function parameter names are scoped to the function body. Note that there is a slight complexity to this. Functions declared as default arguments close over the <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61208843/where-are-arguments-positioned-in-the-lexical-environment/\">parameter list</a>, and not the body of the function.</p>\n<h3>Function declarations</h3>\n<p>Function declarations have block scope in strict mode and function scope in non-strict mode. Note: non-strict mode is a complicated set of emergent rules based on the quirky historical implementations of different browsers.</p>\n<h3>Named function expressions</h3>\n<p>Named function expressions are scoped to themselves (e.g., for the purpose of recursion).</p>\n<h3>Implicitly defined properties on the global object</h3>\n<p>In non-strict mode, implicitly defined properties on the global object have global scope, because the global object sits at the top of the scope chain. In strict mode, these are not permitted.</p>\n<h3>eval</h3>\n<p>In <code>eval</code> strings, variables declared using <code>var</code> will be placed in the current scope, or, if <code>eval</code> is used indirectly, as properties on the global object.</p>\n<h2>Examples</h2>\n<p>The following will throw a ReferenceError because the names<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> have no meaning outside of the function <code>f</code>.</p>\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\" data-console=\"true\" data-babel=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>function f() {\n    var x = 1\n    let y = 1\n    const z = 1\n}\nconsole.log(typeof x) // undefined (because var has function scope!)\nconsole.log(typeof y) // undefined (because the body of the function is a block)\nconsole.log(typeof z) // undefined (because the body of the function is a block)</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n<p>The following will throw a ReferenceError for <code>y</code> and <code>z</code>, but not for <code>x</code>, because the visibility of <code>x</code> is not constrained by the block.

There was a master card referred to as the background. It was transparent and can be seen as the bottom card. Any content on this base card was shared with cards placed on top of it. Each card placed on top had its own content which took precedence over the previous card, but still had access to the prior cards if desired.</p>\n\n<p>This is exactly how the JavaScript scoping system is designed. It just has different names. The cards in JavaScript are known as <strong><a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-10.3\">Execution Contexts<sup>ECMA</sup></a></strong>. Each one of these contexts contains three main parts. A variable environment, a lexical environment, and a this binding. Going back to the cards reference, the lexical environment contains all of the content from prior cards lower in the stack. The current context is at the top of the stack and any content declared there will be stored in the variable environment. The variable environment will take precedence in the case of naming collisions.</p>\n\n<p>The this binding will point to the containing object. Sometimes scopes or execution contexts change without the containing object changing, such as in a declared function where the containing object may be <code>window</code> or a constructor function.</p>\n\n<p>These execution contexts are created any time control is transferred. Control is transferred when code begins to execute, and this is primarily done from function execution. </p>\n\n<p>So that is the technical explanation. In practice, it is important to remember that in JavaScript</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Scopes are technically \"Execution Contexts\"</li>\n<li>Contexts form a stack of environments where variables are stored</li>\n<li>The top of the stack takes precedence (the bottom being the global context)</li>\n<li>Each function creates an execution context (but not always a new this binding)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Applying this to one of the previous examples (5. \"Closure\") on this page, it is possible to follow the stack of execution contexts. In this example there are three contexts in the stack. They are defined by the outer context, the context in the immediately invoked function called by var six, and the context in the returned function inside of var six's immediately invoked function.</p>\n\n<p><em>i</em>) The outer context.

Yet, our variable <code>i</code> is known in the entire function.</p>\n<p>Also, consider that block scoped variables are not known before they are declared because they are not hoisted. You're also not allowed to redeclare the same block scoped variable within the same block.

They cease to exist outside their respective block, so the variable can't be accessed outside the if block.</p>\n"},{"score":2,"body":"<p>A very common issue not described yet that front-end coders often run into is the scope that is visible to an inline event handler in the HTML - for example, with</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;button onclick=\"foo()\"&gt;&lt;/button&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The scope of the variables that an <code>on*</code> attribute can reference <em>must</em> be either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>global (working inline handlers almost always reference global variables)</li>\n<li>a property of the document (eg, <code>querySelector</code> as a standalone variable will point to <code>document.querySelector</code>; rare)</li>\n<li>a property of the element the handler is attached to (like above; rare)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Otherwise, you'll get a ReferenceError when the handler is invoked. So, for example, if the inline handler references a function which is defined <em>inside</em> <code>window.onload</code> or <code>$(function() {</code>, the reference will fail, because the inline handler may only reference variables in the global scope, and the function is not global:</p>\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"true\" data-console=\"true\" data-babel=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () =&gt; {\r\n  function foo() {\r\n    console.log('foo running');\r\n  }\r\n});</code></pre>\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;button onclick=\"foo()\"&gt;click&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Properties of the <code>document</code> and properties of the element the handler is attached to may also be referenced as standalone variables inside inline handlers because inline handlers are invoked <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dTDB0.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>inside</em> of two <code>with</code> blocks</a>, one for the <code>document</code>, one for the element. The scope chain of variables inside these handlers is <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57048067\">extremely unintuitive</a>, and a working event handler will <em>probably</em> require a function to be global (and unnecessary global pollution <a href=\"https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/q/148108\">should probably be avoided</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Since the scope chain inside inline handlers is <em>so weird</em>, and since inline handlers require global pollution to work, and since inline handlers sometimes require ugly string escaping when passing arguments, it's probably easier to avoid them. Instead, attach event handlers using Javascript (like with <code>addEventListener</code>), rather than with HTML markup.</p>\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"true\" data-console=\"true\" data-babel=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>function foo() {\r\n  console.log('foo running');\r\n}\r\ndocument.querySelector('.my-button').addEventListener('click', foo);</code></pre>\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;button class=\"my-button\"&gt;click&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>On a different note, unlike normal <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags, which run on the top level, code inside ES6 modules runs in its own private scope. A variable defined at the top of a normal <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag is global, so you can reference it in other <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags, like this:</p>\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"true\" data-console=\"true\" data-babel=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;script&gt;\r\nconst foo = 'foo';\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;script&gt;\r\nconsole.log(foo);\r\n&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n\n<p>But the top level of an ES6 module is <em>not</em> global. A variable declared at the top of an ES6 module will only be visible inside that module, unless the variable is explicitly <code>export</code>ed, or unless it's assigned to a property of the global object.</p>\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"true\" data-console=\"true\" data-babel=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;script type=\"module\"&gt;\r\nconst foo = 'foo';\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;script&gt;\r\n// Can't access foo here, because the other script is a module\r\nconsole.log(typeof foo);\r\n&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n\n<p>The top level of an ES6 module is similar to that of the inside of an IIFE on the top level in a normal <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>. The module can reference any variables which are global, and nothing can reference anything inside the module unless the module is explicitly designed for it.</p>\n"},{"score":0,"body":"<p>I really like the accepted answer but I want to add this:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scope collects and maintains a look-up list of all the declared identifiers (variables), and enforces a strict set of rules as to how these are accessible to currently executing code.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Scope is a set of rules for looking up variables by their identifier name.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If a variable cannot be found in the immediate scope, Engine consults the next outer containing scope, continuing until is found or until the outermost (a.k.a., global) scope has been reached. </li>\n<li>Is the set of rules that determines where and how a variable (identifier) can be looked up.
