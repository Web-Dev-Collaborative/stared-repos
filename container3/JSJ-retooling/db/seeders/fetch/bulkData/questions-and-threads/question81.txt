My feeling is that Node.js is especially suited for applications where you'd like to maintain a persistent connection from the browser back to the server. Using a technique known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\"long-polling\"</a>, you can write an application that sends updates to the user in real time. Doing long polling on many of the web's giants, like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ruby on Rails</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_%28web_framework%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Django</a>, would create immense load on the server, because each active client eats up one server process. This situation amounts to a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarpit_(networking)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">tarpit</a> attack. When you use something like Node.js, the server has no need of maintaining separate threads for each open connection.  </p>\n\n<p>This means you can create a <a href=\"https://github.com/rivalslayer/node_chat\" rel=\"noreferrer\">browser-based chat application</a> in Node.js that takes almost no system resources to serve a great many clients. Any time you want to do this sort of long-polling, Node.js is a great option.  </p>\n\n<p>It's worth mentioning that Ruby and Python both have tools to do this sort of thing (<a href=\"http://rubyeventmachine.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">eventmachine</a> and <a href=\"https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">twisted</a>, respectively), but that Node.js does it exceptionally well, and from the ground up. JavaScript is exceptionally well situated to a callback-based concurrency model, and it excels here. Also, being able to serialize and deserialize with JSON native to both the client and the server is pretty nifty. </p>\n\n<p>I look forward to reading other answers here, this is a fantastic question. </p>\n\n<p>It's worth pointing out that Node.js is also great for situations in which you'll be reusing a lot of code across the client/server gap. The <a href=\"http://meteor.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Meteor framework</a> makes this really easy, and a lot of folks are suggesting this might be the future of web development. I can say from experience that it's a whole lot of fun to write code in Meteor, and a big part of this is spending less time thinking about how you're going to restructure your data, so the code that runs in the browser can easily manipulate it and pass it back. </p>\n\n<p>Here's an article on Pyramid and long-polling, which turns out to be very easy to set up with a little help from gevent: <a href=\"http://michael.merickel.org/2011/6/21/tictactoe-and-long-polling-with-pyramid/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>TicTacToe and Long Polling with Pyramid</em></a>.</p>\n"},{"score":409,"body":"<p>I believe Node.js is best suited for real-time applications: online games, collaboration tools, chat rooms, or anything where what one user (or robot?  or sensor?) does with the application needs to be seen by other users immediately, without a page refresh.</p>\n\n<p>I should also mention that Socket.IO in combination with Node.js will reduce your real-time latency even further than what is possible with long polling.  Socket.IO will fall back to long polling as a worst case scenario, and instead use web sockets or even Flash if they are available.</p>\n\n<p>But I should also mention that just about any situation where the code might block due to threads can be better addressed with Node.js.  Or any situation where you need the application to be event-driven.</p>\n\n<p>Also, Ryan Dahl said in a talk that I once attended that the Node.js benchmarks closely rival Nginx for regular old HTTP requests.

From last 2 years I am working on JavaScript and developing web front end and I am enjoying it. Back end guys provide’s us some API’s written in Java,python (we don’t care) and we simply write a AJAX call, get our data and guess what ! we are done. But in real it is not that easy, If data we are getting is not correct or there is some server error then we stuck and we have to contact our back end guys over the mail or chat(sometimes on whatsApp too :).) This is not cool. What if we wrote our API’s in JavaScript and call those API’s from our front end ? Yes that’s pretty cool because if we face any problem in API we can look into it. Guess what ! you can do this now , How ? – Node is there for you.</p>\n\n<p>Ok agreed that you can write your API in JavaScript but what if I am ok with above problem. Do you have any other reason to use node for rest API ?</p>\n\n<p>so here is the magic begins. Yes I do have other reasons to use node for our API’s.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s go back to our traditional rest API system which is based on either blocking operation or threading. Suppose two concurrent request occurs( r1 and r2) , each of them require database operation. So In traditional system what will happens :</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Waiting Way :</strong> Our server starts serving <code>r1</code> request and waits for query response. after completion of <code>r1</code> , server starts to serve <code>r2</code> and does it in same way. So waiting is not a good idea because we don’t have that much time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Threading Way :</strong> Our server will creates two threads for both requests <code>r1</code> and <code>r2</code> and serve their purpose after querying database so cool its fast.But it is memory consuming because you can see we started two threads also problem increases when both request is querying same data then you have to deal with deadlock kind of issues . So its better than waiting way but still issues are there.</p>\n\n<p>Now here is , how node will do it:</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Nodeway :</strong> When same concurrent request comes in node then it will register an event with its callback and move ahead it will not wait for query response for a particular request.So when <code>r1</code> request comes then node’s event loop (yes there is an event loop in node which serves this purpose.) register an event with its callback function and move ahead for serving <code>r2</code> request and similarly register its event with its callback. Whenever any query finishes it triggers its corresponding event and execute its callback  to completion without being interrupted.</p>\n\n<p>So no waiting, no threading , no memory consumption – yes this is nodeway for serving rest API.</p>\n"},{"score":15,"body":"<p><strong>Donning asbestos longjohns...</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yesterday my title with Packt Publications, <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1783558555\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Reactive Programming with JavaScript</a>.

With Node.js, the default behavior is that if you make one change, the old version continues to be active until the end of time or until you manually stop and restart the server. This inappropriate behavior doesn’t just annoy Pythonistas; it also irritates native Node.js users who provide various workarounds. The StackOverflow question “Auto-reload of files in Node.js” has, at the time of this writing, over 200 upvotes and 19 answers; an edit directs the user to a nanny script, node-supervisor, with homepage at <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/reactjs-node-supervisor\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://tinyurl.com/reactjs-node-supervisor</a>. This problem affords new users with great opportunity to feel stupid because they thought they had fixed the problem, but the old, buggy behavior is completely unchanged. And it is easy to forget to bounce the server; I have done so multiple times. And the message I would like to give is, “No, you’re not stupid because this behavior of Node.js bit your back; it’s just that the designers of Node.js saw no reason to provide appropriate behavior here. Do try to cope with it, perhaps taking a little help from node-supervisor or another solution, but please don’t walk away feeling that you’re stupid. You’re not the one with the problem; the problem is in Node.js’s default behavior.”</p>\n  \n  <p>This section, after some debate, was left in, precisely because I don't want to give an impression of “It’s easy.” I cut my hands repeatedly while getting things to work, and I don’t want to smooth over difficulties and set you up to believe that getting Node.js and its ecosystem to function well is a straightforward matter and if it’s not straightforward for you too, you don’t know what you’re doing. If you don’t run into obnoxious difficulties using Node.js, that’s wonderful. If you do, I would hope that you don’t walk away feeling, “I’m stupid—there must be something wrong with me.” You’re not stupid if you experience nasty surprises dealing with Node.js. It’s not you! It’s Node.js and its ecosystem!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Appendix, which I did not really want after the rising crescendo in the last chapters and the conclusion, talks about what I was able to find in the ecosystem, and provided a workaround for moronic literalism:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Another database that seemed like a perfect fit, and may yet be redeemable, is a server-side implementation of the HTML5 key-value store. This approach has the cardinal advantage of an API that most good front-end developers understand well enough. For that matter, it’s also an API that most not-so-good front-end developers understand well enough. But with the node-localstorage package, while dictionary-syntax access is not offered (you want to use localStorage.setItem(key, value) or localStorage.getItem(key), not localStorage[key]), the full localStorage semantics are implemented, including a default 5MB quota—<em>WHY?</em> Do server-side JavaScript developers need to be protected from themselves?</p>\n  \n  <p>For client-side database capabilities, a 5MB quota per website is really a generous and useful amount of breathing room to let developers work with it. You could set a much lower quota and still offer developers an immeasurable improvement over limping along with cookie management. A 5MB limit doesn’t lend itself very quickly to Big Data client-side processing, but there is a really quite generous allowance that resourceful developers can use to do a lot. But on the other hand, 5MB is not a particularly large portion of most disks purchased any time recently, meaning that if you and a website disagree about what is reasonable use of disk space, or some site is simply hoggish, it does not really cost you much and you are in no danger of a swamped hard drive unless your hard drive was already too full. Maybe we would be better off if the balance were a little less or a little more, but overall it’s a decent solution to address the intrinsic tension for a client-side context.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, it might gently be pointed out that when you are the one writing code for your server, you don’t need any additional protection from making your database more than a tolerable 5MB in size. Most developers will neither need nor want tools acting as a nanny and protecting them from storing more than 5MB of server-side data. And the 5MB quota that is a golden balancing act on the client-side is rather a bit silly on a Node.js server. (And, for a database for multiple users such as is covered in this Appendix, it might be pointed out, slightly painfully, that that’s not 5MB per user account unless you create a separate database on disk for each user account; that’s 5MB shared between all user accounts together. That could get <em>painful</em> if you go viral!) The documentation states that the quota is customizable, but an email a week ago to the developer asking how to change the quota is unanswered, as was the StackOverflow question asking the same. The only answer I have been able to find is in the Github CoffeeScript source, where it is listed as an optional second integer argument to a constructor. So that’s easy enough, and you could specify a quota equal to a disk or partition size. But besides porting a feature that does not make sense, the tool’s author has failed completely to follow a very standard convention of interpreting 0 as meaning “unlimited” for a variable or function where an integer is to specify a maximum limit for some resource use. The best thing to do with this misfeature is probably to specify that the quota is Infinity:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>if (typeof localStorage === 'undefined' || localStorage === null)\n  {      \n  var LocalStorage = require('node-localstorage').LocalStorage;\n  localStorage = new LocalStorage(__dirname + '/localStorage',\n    Infinity);\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Swapping two comments in order:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>People needlessly shot themselves in the foot constantly using JavaScript as a whole, and part of JavaScript being made respectable language was a Douglas Crockford saying in essence, “JavaScript as a language has some really good parts and some really bad parts. Here are the good parts. Just forget that anything else is there.” Perhaps the hot Node.js ecosystem will grow its <strong>own</strong> “Douglas Crockford,” who will say, “The Node.js ecosystem is a coding Wild West, but there are some real gems to be found. Here’s a roadmap. Here are the areas to avoid at almost any cost. Here are the areas with some of the richest paydirt to be found in ANY language or environment.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Perhaps someone else can take those words as a challenge, and follow Crockford’s lead and write up “the good parts” and / or “the better parts” for Node.js and its ecosystem. I’d buy a copy!</p>\n  \n  <p>And given the degree of enthusiasm and sheer work-hours on all projects, it may be warranted in a year, or two, or three, to sharply temper any remarks about an immature ecosystem made at the time of this writing. It really may make sense in five years to say, “The 2015 Node.js ecosystem had several minefields. The 2020 Node.js ecosystem has multiple paradises.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"score":-2,"body":"<p>I can share few points where&amp;why to use node js.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>For realtime applications like chat,collaborative editing better we go with nodejs as it is event base where fire event and data to clients from server. </li>\n<li>Simple and easy to understand as it is javascript base where most of people have idea.</li>\n<li>Most of current web applications going towards  angular js&amp;backbone, with node it is easy to interact with client side code as both will use json data. </li>\n<li>Lot of plugins available.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Drawbacks:-</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Node will support most of databases but best is mongodb which won't support complex joins and others.</li>\n<li>Compilation Errors...developer should handle each and every exceptions other wise if any error accord application will stop working  where again we need to go and start it manually or using  any automation tool. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Conclusion:- \nNodejs best to use for simple and real time applications..if you have very big business logic and complex functionality better should not use nodejs.\nIf you want to build an application along with chat and any collaborative functionality.. node can be used in specific parts and remain should go with your convenience technology.</p>\n"}],"score":2195}
