The GUI uses the Web Audio Controls web components by g200Kg.

How to use?
-----------

For the moment, you need Google Chrome or FF Nightly or Opera.

The Amp has been tested with a Mac Book Pro and different sound cards (Apogee Jam, different Presonus and RMEs) and works in real time with a very low latency (8-12ms). The latency is system and sound card dependent, so you've got to try. On Windows the web browsers only support WASAPI drivers, giving a minimul latency of 10ms, add to this the latency of the amp and you are around 14ms, not so good. FF should support Jack for Windows soon. On Linux Jack is uspported by FireFox Nightly, people told me it worked with low latency.

You can try the Amp Sim without a guitar, just go to https://mainline.i3s.unice.fr/AmpSim, wait until the eq sliders come up (that
means that the reverb and cabinet simulator impulses have been loaded and decoded), and press the play button of the audio player on
the left. Then you can try adjusting the knobs, sliders, etc. You can also choose different demo direct input tracks in the menu below the audio player.

If you want to try with a real guitar, it's better to use an external sound card, plug your guitar in it and set this input as the
default input in your Operating System preferences. Then reload the page and press the button that is animated (zomming in and out) in
the front panel of the Amp: it will enable microphone or sound card input. Then play :-) Don't forget to adjust the input gain of your sound card, then of the amp sim (rotating knob in the middle of the speaker)

How to run from github?
-----------------------
Clone the repo, then run "npm install" and "node server.js". By default the server runs on port 8082 so open  http://localhost:8082 in
your browser. You can change the port, edit server.js.

If you plan to host the app somewhere, you need to have a server that support HTTPS as the getUserMedia API we use for getting the input audio stream from the microphone or sound card requires HTTPS.

How to add presets?
-------------------

So far, there is no persistence system implemented for saving the presets. There are all located in the amp.js file, look for "preset".
If you open the console in your browser devtools and press the "show current settings" button, then it will print an array object in the
console. Just copy and paste this value in the code of amp.js, after the current presets. If it sounds good, do not forget to email this
to me too (micbuffa@gmail.com).
