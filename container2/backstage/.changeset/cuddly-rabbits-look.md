'@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend': patch
---

Action needed: If you are using the templates located at https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/ in your Backstage app directly using the URL via the `app-config.yaml`, you should copy over the templates inside your org and import from there. The templates have now been moved to https://github.com/backstage/software-templates. See https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/6415 for explanation.
