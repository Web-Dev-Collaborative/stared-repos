title: Supported Integrations
---

We worked with **documentation website generators** to have DocSearch directly
embedded as a first class citizen in the websites they produce.

## Our great integrations

So, if you're using one of the following tools, checkout their documentation to
see how to enable DocSearch on your website:

- [Docusaurus][1] - [How to enable search][2]
- [VuePress][3] - [Algolia Search][4]
- [pkgdown][5] - [DocSearch indexing][6]
- [LaRecipe][7] - [Algolia Search][8]
- [Orchid][9] - [Algolia Search][10]

If you're maintaining a similar tool and want us to add you to the list, [get in
touch with us][11]. We'd be happy to help.
